## Portfolio Backend Documentation

This documentation provides an overview and setup guide for the backend of my portfolio website, as typically structured in backend portfolio repositories.

---

## **Overview**

The backend serves as the core API and data management layer for your portfolio website. It handles all server-side logic, data storage, and provides RESTful endpoints for the frontend to interact with. By decoupling the backend from the frontend, you gain flexibility, maintainability, and scalability for your project[2][6].

---

## **Repository**

- **Backend GitHub URL:** [https://github.com/gihanchamila/portfolio-backend](https://github.com/gihanchamila/portfolio-backend)

---

## **Technologies Used**

- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server applications
- **Express.js**: Web framework for creating REST APIs
- **MongoDB** (or another database): For storing portfolio data (projects, skills, contact info, etc.)
- **Mongoose** (if using MongoDB): ODM for MongoDB
- **ESLint**: For code linting and maintaining standards

---

## **Features**

- RESTful API endpoints for managing portfolio content
- CRUD operations for projects, skills, contact forms, etc.
- Data validation and error handling
- Authentication for admin endpoints
- API usage analytics

---

## **Getting Started**

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gihanchamila/portfolio-backend.git
   cd portfolio-backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   - Create a `.env` file at the root with necessary variables (e.g., `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.)

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - The server should now be running on the configured port (default: 3000 or as specified).

---

## **Development Notes**

- Use ESLint for code quality checks.
- Structure your code with clear separation of routes, controllers, and models.
- Write unit and integration tests for API endpoints.

## **Why Use a Backend for a Portfolio?**

- **Flexibility:** The frontend can be updated or replaced without touching backend logic.
- **Maintainability:** Centralized content management.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Clean division between data management and UI[2].
- **Accessibility:** The API can be reused for different clients or platforms.

---

## **Connecting to the Frontend**

- Ensure the frontend API base URL points to your backend server.
- CORS should be configured to allow requests from your frontend domain.
